config DISPLAY_CVITEK_LVDS
	bool "LVDS Port"
	help
	  This enables Low-voltage Differential Signaling(LVDS) display support.
	  LVDS is a high-speed, long-distance digital interface for serial
	  communication (sending one bit at time) over two copper wires
	  (differential) that are placed at 180 degrees from each other.

config DISPLAY_CVITEK_I80
	bool "I80 Port"
	help
	  This enables Intel 8080(I80) display support.
	  Intel 8080 (I80) is one kind of the most common LCD MPU parallel
	  interfaces, LCD controller signals are divided into two types:
	  data signals and control signals.

config DISPLAY_CVITEK_MIPI
	bool "DSI Port"
	help
	  This enables Display Serial Interface(DSI) display support.
	  The MIPI Display Serial Interface (MIPI DSI) defines a
	  high-speed serial interface between a host processor and
	  a display module.
